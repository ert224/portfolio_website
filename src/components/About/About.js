              As a gay Latino in tech, finding a workplace that values diversity and inclusivity is essential to me. I seek an environment where I can confidently bring my authentic self to work, allowing me to focus on delivering high-quality results. Outside of work, I enjoy board games, video games, photography, anime, and sketching, which help me maintain a healthy work-life balance and fuel my creativity.
